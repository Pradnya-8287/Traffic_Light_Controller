# Traffic_Light_Controller
This project implements a Traffic Light Controller FSM using Verilog HDL and simulates it using Icarus Verilog with waveform analysis in GTKWave.
The controller manages traffic lights for:
- Main Road 1 (M1)
- Main Road 2 (M2)
- Main Turn (MT)
- Side Road (S)
Each traffic light follows the Red–Yellow–Green (RYG) sequence based on a timed finite state machine.
